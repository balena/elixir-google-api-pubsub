defmodule GoogleApi.PubSub.V1.Model.ExpirationPolicy do
  @moduledoc """
  A policy that specifies the conditions for resource expiration (i.e., automatic resource deletion).

  ## Attributes

  - ttl (String.t): Specifies the \&quot;time-to-live\&quot; duration for an associated resource. The resource expires if it is not active for a period of &#x60;ttl&#x60;. The definition of \&quot;activity\&quot; depends on the type of the associated resource. The minimum and maximum allowed values for &#x60;ttl&#x60; depend on the type of the associated resource, as well. If &#x60;ttl&#x60; is not set, the associated resource never expires. Defaults to: `null`.
