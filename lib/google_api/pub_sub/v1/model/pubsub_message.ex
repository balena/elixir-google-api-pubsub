defmodule GoogleApi.PubSub.V1.Model.PubsubMessage do
  @moduledoc """
  A message that is published by publishers and consumed by subscribers. The message must contain either a non-empty data field or at least one attribute. Note that client libraries represent this object differently depending on the language. See the corresponding &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/libraries\&quot;&gt;client library documentation&lt;/a&gt; for more information. See &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/quotas\&quot;&gt;Quotas and limits&lt;/a&gt; for more information about message limits.

  ## Attributes

  - attributes (%{optional(String.t) &#x3D;&gt; String.t}): Optional attributes for this message. Defaults to: `null`.
  - data (binary()): The message data field. If this field is empty, the message must contain at least one attribute. Defaults to: `null`.
  - messageId (String.t): ID of this message, assigned by the server when the message is published. Guaranteed to be unique within the topic. This value may be read by a subscriber that receives a &#x60;PubsubMessage&#x60; via a &#x60;Pull&#x60; call or a push delivery. It must not be populated by the publisher in a &#x60;Publish&#x60; call. Defaults to: `null`.
  - publishTime (String.t): The time at which the message was published, populated by the server when it receives the &#x60;Publish&#x60; call. It must not be populated by the publisher in a &#x60;Publish&#x60; call. Defaults to: `null`.
